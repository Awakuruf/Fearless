### 💡 Inspiration
The creation of this app originated from the personal experience of peers around me and it focuses on three key major traits which are: Independence, Taking control and Empowerment. 
Vulnerable individuals can now take control of their safety and access the support when they need it the most!
- 🚀 Independence
  - Allow vulnerable individuals to regain their sense of independence when walking alone in unfamiliar areas or at night. 
- 🕹 Taking Control
  - Vulnerable individuals can now take control of their safety and access the support when they need it most.
- ✊ Empowerment
  - Experience a sense of safety and empowerment while confidently walking, no longer experiencing the feelings of powerlessness.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 User Journey
For vulnerable individuals travelling to unfamiliar areas or walking alone at night, walking can be an anxiety-inducing experience. 
They may not feel comfortable contacting traditional emergency services such as 911 until it’s too late. 
This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and a sense of isolation. 
This application mitigates these problems by integrating preparedness and adaptability.

The mobile navigation app “Fearless” addresses this problem by providing a range of safety tools and resources, including 📞 fake call feature , 🚨 alert button, and ⛔️ real time information on dangerous areas.

Being newcomers to these technologies, we're still in the blueprint phase. Here's a roadmap:
1. 🧭 Broaden our horizons by researching more capabilities and tools.
2. 🛠️ Finalize our tech stack and architectural design.
3. 📝 Segment the project into sizable tasks.
4. 🔍 Further dissect these tasks into actionable tickets that can be individually managed.
5. 🤝 Collaborate during the foundational setup.
6. 🖥️ Build a functional, user-friendly application.
7. 🚀 Launch to the web.
8. 🚪 Open our doors to external developer contributions, expanding beyond just CS roles.

In-depth documentation 📚 will accompany the project, ensuring that even those with minimal experience can jump in and contribute. It's an exciting venture, especially for those keen on exploring Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the intricacies of software development.

### 🌟 Potential Extensions:
- **User Profiles**: Tailored by history, favorite destination, and more.
  - 🎨 Custom experiences can be curated based on these details.
- **More Platforms**: The more, the merrier. 🎉
  - 🕷️ Custom scrapers will be necessary due to unique site structures.
- **Notifications**: 📧 Email or messages via AWS SNS for alert updates.
- **Real Time Update**: 📄 Concurrently analyze on-going news events via AWS Kinesis Datastream.

... and countless other possibilities! 🌌
